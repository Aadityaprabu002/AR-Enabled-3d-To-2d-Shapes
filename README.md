# 📐 AR Learning App – From 3D to 2D Shapes

An **Augmented Reality (AR) application** designed for **second-grade students** to understand the relationship between **3D objects** and their **2D projections**.

## Note: download the app from gdrive link below because it is larger to be stored in github.

This project is inspired by the **Government of Tamil Nadu – Grade 2 Mathematics Textbook (Unit: Geometry)**, which introduces children to cubes, cuboids, cones, cylinders, spheres, and their corresponding 2D shapes.

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 **Interactive AR Room**: Spawns a virtual classroom space where students can explore shapes.
- 🔺 **Learn Shapes Visually**: Observe real-world 3D objects (cube, cuboid, cone, cylinder, sphere) and their 2D impressions.
- 📏 **Practical Understanding**: Inspired by textbook activities such as **shadow tracing** and **inkpad impressions** to highlight how **2D shapes emerge from 3D objects**.
- 🎮 **Fun & Engaging**: Game-like interactions keep young learners motivated.
- 📱 **Mobile Ready**: Build once in **Unity3D** and deploy as an APK for Android devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity3D** – Game Engine
- **C#** – Core Programming Language
- **Unity AR Foundation / ARKit / ARCore** – Plane Tracking
- **Vuforia** – Image Target Recognition

## 📚 Educational Context

This project extends the **Tamil Nadu SCERT Grade 2 Mathematics (Term 1) textbook**, particularly the chapter:

> _"Introduction to 3D Shapes & Identification of 2D Shapes from 3D Objects"_

Example activities from the book include:

- Tracing **shadows** of 3D objects to reveal their 2D forms.
- Using clay to transform a **sphere → cylinder → cuboid → cube**.
- Pressing dice/erasers on inkpads to reveal **2D impressions**.

Our AR app brings these activities to life in a digital, interactive format.
